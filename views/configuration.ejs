    <h2>Slack module Configuration</h2>


    <h3>Step 1: Get your Slack API Key</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>To get an API key, first go to the Slack apps management page at <a href="https://api.slack.com/apps">https://api.slack.com/apps</a></li>
        <li>If you aren’t signed in, click ‘sign in to your Slack account’ to manage your team’s apps.</li>
        <li>Once you’re signed in, click the ‘Create an App’ button in the middle of the screen. (If you’ve created a Slack app before you’ll find the button in the upper-right corner)</li>
        <li>Give your app a name, such as “Gladys”, and choose the Slack team where you want it the app installed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step 2: Add a New ‘Bot User’</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To add a new bot user, select ‘Bot users’ under the features heading on the left-hand side navigation of the app configuration page.</li>
        <li>Click the ‘Add a bot user’ button and give it username, such as @gladys.</li>
        <li>Keep the ‘always appear online’ slider in the off position (we want our slackbot to appear offline if it crashes) and then click the add bot user button.</li>
        <li>Finally, we have to give our slackbot access to slack with our API key. Select ‘OAuth & Permissions’ under the features heading on the left-hand side navigation of the app configuration page and click the ‘Install App to Team’ button.</li>
        <li>After you authorize the slackbot, you will then have access to the OAuth tokens - click ‘copy’ next to the slackbot user OAuth token to get the token on your clipboard!</li>
    </ul>
